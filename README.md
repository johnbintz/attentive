Attentive is a new take on Ruby presentation software. It provides lots of smart things already set up for you:

* A simple slide transition system using a slightly hacked up version of Fathom.js.
* Sass, Compass, and CoffeeScript all plugged into Sprockets and ready to generate your presentation's CSS and JavaScripts.
* Pygments for syntax highlighting.
* Simple slide syntax, really really similar to how Showoff does it.
