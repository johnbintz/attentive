Attentive is a new take on Ruby presentation software. It provides lots of smart things already set up for you:

* A simple slide transition system using a slightly hacked up version of Fathom.js.
* Sass, Compass, and CoffeeScript all plugged into Sprockets and ready to generate your presentation's CSS and JavaScripts.
* Pygments for syntax highlighting.
* Simple slide syntax, really really similar to how Showoff does it.

Here's what you can do:

`attentive create <presenation name>`

Create a new presentation.

`attentive`

Run the presentation that's in the current directory on port 9393.

`attentive start -p <port>`

Run the current presentation on another port.
