Attentive is a new take on Ruby presentation software. It provides lots of smart things already set up for you:

* A simple slide transition system written from scratch with no jQuery (oh snap!)
* Sass, Compass, and CoffeeScript all plugged into Sprockets and ready to generate your presentation's CSS and JavaScripts.
* Pygments for syntax highlighting.
* Simple slide syntax, really really similar to how Showoff does it.

Here's what you can do:

`attentive create <presenation name>`

Create a new presentation.

`attentive`

Run the presentation that's in the current directory on port 9393.

`attentive start -p <port>`

Run the current presentation on another port.

`attentive static`

Generate a static copy of the presentation and dependent files into `_site`.

Edit `presentation.rb` and start adding `.slides` files in `presentation/`. The files are processed in sort order.

While the presentation is running:

* Click a slide, use the spacebar, or the right arrow to advance
* Use the left arrow to go back
* Hit [ Shift ]-T to toggle a timer on and off, then lowercase t to turn it on and off
* Hit \ to reset the timer
